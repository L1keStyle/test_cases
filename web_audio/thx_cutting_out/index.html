		<h1>Play THX sound</h1>
		<p>This should play the entire THX sound for 26 seconds, but it either cuts out too early or doesn't play anything at all in latest Nightly (46 2016-01-15). The "speaker" icon on the tab is active throughout even if nothing or just some weird tap tap tap noise can be heard.</p>
